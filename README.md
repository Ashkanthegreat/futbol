## Inheritance

2.  Plan here is to make a 'Stats' class which will pass common behaviors to our game_team, game, and team classes.

3. Initialize method for the 4 sub classes.

## Additional Classes

5. Plan here is to implement classes specifically for our seasonal data and other functionalities. As well as finding more good use cases for our mocks and stubs.
